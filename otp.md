Otp encryption is when you encrypt all the bits by having a key of equal lenght and adding them together. This is just like the thing you submitted for the kids code thing in dublin that was amazing! 

The problem with this is that

- You need a lot of keys, hard disk example.
- You need a lot of keys for different people

However it does give perfect secrecy. 

The reason for this is that the C gives NO information about M. You could turn that C into any M and you would not know if it was the right one. Nice.
