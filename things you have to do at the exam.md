This is a list of things that where mentioned to come back at the exam. 

- euclidian algoritm for gcd
- exstended euclidian algoritm for gcd
- Square and multiply 
- What is sound
- What is complete
- What is Snorr how does it work 
- Weierstrass equation (all prime eliptic curves can be represented by it)
- Domain parameters in eliptic curves [[eliptic cuve groups]]
- Adding two points in elliptic curves

- compressed point representation eliptic curve el gamal
- why is crt faster than rsa in private key exponentation. addition does not change it. 
- Double and add algorithm [[eliptic cuve groups]]
- Square and multiply algoritm
- When is a group cyclic
- When is an elliptic curve cyclic. 
- Baby step algoritm you have to perform it
- Giant step algoritm you have to perform it
- You definity have to perform Pollard discrete log.
