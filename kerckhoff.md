The kerckhoff principle states that the security of a security method should never come from the secrecy of the algoritm but only from the secrecy of the key. This makes sense because once the algorithm inevitably leaks its usually over for everyone. If a key leaks it is only over for the poor person that had their key leaked. Public algorithms also allow public scrutiny. This keeps out bad schemes.
