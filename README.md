# cryptography-notes

This repo holds the notes I created for the Introduction to Cryptography course from Radboud university which I took in the second semester of 2021. 

These notes are best read using the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) program as that is what I used to create them.

I will probably extend these notes now with my notes for the Cryptography course from Radboud university.
