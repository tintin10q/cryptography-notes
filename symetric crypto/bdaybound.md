The birthday bound says that the more queries you make the more the chance that you have a collision. This is the chance increases because each time there is less chance that it is not a collision. 

First the chance is 0
Then it is $1/2^n$
Then it is $2/2^n$
Then it is $3/2^n$
...
...
...
Then it is $n/2^n$ Around halfway here the chance is 50%


Its about collisions.
