A probability of something is 

The numer of outcomes something happens / the number of possible outcomes

10 red cards out of 40 cards

probability of a red card is 10/40 = 0.25 = 25%

When multiple events happen after eachother we:

multiply the probabilties if we want to know the probability BOTH or all the events happening
We add the probabilities if we want to know the chance of either probabilities happening. I feel this makes intiitive sense. Both happening is less chance one happening is more chance.


If the distinguiser is if the byte is 00 then this is $$\frac{1}{255} ~ \text{bytes} = \frac{1}{2^8} = 2^{-8}$$

Then if we want to know this advantage for M bytes this is $(2^{ -8 })^M = (\frac{1}{2^8})^M$
