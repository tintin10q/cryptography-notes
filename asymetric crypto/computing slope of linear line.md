# Calculating a line between two points

## Steps
1. Write down the points and the linear formula
2. Compute the slope
3. Fill in a point and slope in the formula to get b

## Explication

### Write down the points and the linear formula
You want the line between these points:

- $P = (x_p, y_p)$
- $Q = (x_q, y_q)$

With this formula:
- $y = slope*x+b$

### How to compute the slope
Then you do: $\frac{y_p-y_q}{x_p-x_q}$ or now without \frac $(y_p-y_p)/(x_p-x_q)$. This is the $slope$. 

This gives you the slope of the line and makes you able to draw a line through the points. 

## Fill in a points in the formula

The linear line formula is $y = slope*x+b$. Now that you have the slope you can find $b$ by just filling in one of the points and the slope. 

If you want you can check your work by checking if the other point is indeed on the line.  

# Example
The points.
- $P = (x_p, y_q) = (12, 7)$
- $Q = (x_q, y_q) = (2, 2)$
- 
Now write down the linear formula.
$y = slope*x + b$

Compute the slope:
$slope$ = $\frac{y_p-y_q}{x_p-x_q}$ = $\frac{12-2}{7-2} = \frac{10}{5} = 2$  

Fill in the points
- $2 = 2*2 + b$
- $2 = 4 + b$
- $b = -2$

Get the line:
$y = 2x+-2$

You can check the other point(s) if you want.
