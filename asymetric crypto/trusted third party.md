A trusted third party TTP is a party that both [Alice and bob](people.md)  trust. Alice and Bob can use the TTP to establish a key when Alice and Bob can not physically meet. Alice and Bob both share a secret key with the TTP. 

Bob says to the TTP I want to communicate with Alice. 
TTP then sends a key to Alice and Bob. But now the TTP also has the key. This could be a problem.


Alice and bob can also trust multiple TTP. Then you can combine the keys from all the parties to get the real key. This way the parties don't have the keys. This can only go wrong if the TTP work together. 

So you can also have shares shemes. You have 5 keys from 5 trusted parties but you only need 3 keys to get the real key. 

TTP can also block people to communicate if they want to censor.
