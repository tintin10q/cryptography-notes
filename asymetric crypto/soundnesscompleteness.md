Completeness is when you have an authentication protocol and you can successfully authenticate if you have the secret. Honest verifier can authenticate. 

Soundness is when you have an authentication protocol and a dishonest verifier can not authenticate. With some very small change it is possible because you can always guess but that change should be small. 

Zero knolege is that you can prove that you know something but you don't learn what it is. You can get zero knolegde by looking at the transcript if its zero knolege you don't learn anything from the transcript. we can make the protocols interractive. You can say something is zero knolege then you can have a simulator which is an algoritm that generates valid transcripts that can not be distingished from real a simulator. This has as side effect that you can not show a transcript to your friends because it could have been faked. When you fake it you don't have to respect time.

With eversen van de graaf you still have to do it 128 times because there are only 2 challenges so how can you solve it.
