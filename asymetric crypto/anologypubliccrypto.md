You have a dictionary from some unknown language to English. There is only one language to English dictionary this is the private key. There are many other way around dictionaries these are the public keys.

The person with the unknown language to English can make messages that people with the other way around dictionaries can actually read. No one else can make messages though.  

You could make the one dict from the other dict but this is a lot of work. 

The creative part of public cryptography is that you find problems that are really hard to do one way and easy to do the other way.
