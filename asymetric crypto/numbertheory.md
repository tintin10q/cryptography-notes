# Prime numbers

Number theory is the theory of numbers. Here are the important rules for this course:

- A number is prime if it is divisible by 1 and by itself. Primes numbers are 2,3,5,7 .. there are an infinite amount. 
- Each number can be written in a unique way as products of primes. Example: 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.. 
- Finding the prime number factorization is a **computational hard problem**. You have to try all prime numbers up to the square root of the number you are checking. 
- Easy for 143 = 11 * 13 but already hard for 2021 = 43 * 47
- 250 bit number took 6000 cpu years to factor.....
- Because this is hard it can be used as a [[publickeycrypto]]  problem. 

# Greatest common divisor
Greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest integer k that divides both n and m to another integer. 

So:
gcd(20, 15) = 5 
20/5 = 4, 15/5 = 3

If the greatest common divisor of two numbers is 1 then say the two numbers are **coprime**.
