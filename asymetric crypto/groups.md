# Groups 

A group is a couple of a set A and a binary operation *. 

The binary operation must satisfy the following properties:

## Explanation of the properties.
1. Any item of the group $\diamondsuit$ another item of the group should be in the group.
2. $\diamondsuit$ has to be associative 
3. There is a neutral element in the group that when applied with  $\diamondsuit$ gives the same result.
4. There has to be a inverse element. Every element of the group has another element of the group that when we apply $\diamondsuit$ we get the inverse. Both ways. 
5.  For every thing if we do $\diamondsuit$ with something from the group its the same the other way around. Not required for group.

If abelian is true you can say an albelian group. 

### Finite or Infinite groups
A group finite if there are not an infinite amount of elements in the set A. 

### Order of the group
The order of the group is the cardanality of the group. 

### Examples of groups:

So the set of all integers for instance with +. 

A group is not a group if the properties of groups are not true. 

# Notation:
he conventions for groups is:

There is many more conventions. Plus can be defined in many different ways but they have to kind of satisfy additive and multiplicative rules when defining the operation so everyone know the basic rules.  

If you write only the set then we assume the additive group. 

# Cyclic behavior in finite groups.

To go to a previous iteration you need the inverse of a. At i=0 there is 1. 

The cyclic group 

## Generators

# Subgroups
if You have a group (A, \*) then you can take a part of A with the same operation that is also a group. 

The rules for this is:

The requirements of a subgroup is smaller then a group.

There is a very important theorem with this:

We can also have cyclic subgroups. Cycle in the way of how we cycle with mod.

Apparently understanding these things can save a lot of computation. 

# Example from the lecture:

If you have Z/21Z 21... look it back in the lecture 9

Groups are a set of symmetrical things. 

Think about it symmetry is when you do an action and it looks the same. The idea is that you can do the action and IT IS STILL IN THE GROUP!

The whole counting thing with the permutations and combinations is just finding the number of elements in the group defined by the actions. The permutations and combinations are just different constraints on type type of symmetry. Thats why it always felt so arbitrary.
