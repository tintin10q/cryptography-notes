Fields are special [[rings]] . 

You have this ring:

$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$

You have to see this as combining two groups:

$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},+)$
and
$((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\},\text{x}))$

You can call this ring a field if:
- p is prime!!!!
- $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group
- $((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{0\},\text{x}))$ is a group.

I think 2 and 3 are only true if they are a prime. 

Dan is $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$ a field. Because it is $\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}$ it is a finite set. So you call this a finite field.

You can write it as $\mathbb{F}_p$ or GF(p)

Every prime and every prime power has a field apparently. 
But this case only threads $p^n$ where n = 1.

So a field is 2 groups.

- Additive group has order p 
- multiplicative group has order p-1 (because \ {0})
- there is exactly one finite field per prime

[[eliptic curve]] curves are lines though these fields.
