A ring is a set with 2 operations. 

(x and +)

So you write it like this. 

$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$

You have to see this as combining two groups:

$(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},+)$
and
$((\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x}))$

If $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, \text{+})$ is a group.
and  $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, \text{+}$ is closed, associative and has neutral element 1. 
and x is distributive with respect to +. So:

$∀a, b, c ∈ A : a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and $(b + c)a = ba + ca$

The idea is that this holds for $(\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$

But we are interested in finite sets so we do $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$

So this is only with a set till and including q. So there are p  elements in the set. So $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z},\text{x, +})$ is a ring with p elements. 

In rings elements do not need to have an inverse. If we want to have inverses we get to fields. 

Ok.. now go to [[fields]]
